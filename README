-CONTROLS:
Move Left = Left Arrow

-MATERIALS & METHODS:
This game was created using pygame, a cross-platform set of Python modules.
The graphics used in the game were from an open-source assets library.
For the pseudorandom generation of the blocks, the random package in python
was used for.
For the frames and timing, the clock package was used, which controls the
update speed for the program.

Due to the use of the clock package, the numerical variables for movement
and platform generation speed were extremely hard to tweak, resulting in
bugs in the generation of new blocks. Another issue was the fact that
sprites in groups are not tracked by location which means that combined
with the continuously proceeding platform, the sprites are unable to be
located on the main map and removed completed, only killed temporarily.
